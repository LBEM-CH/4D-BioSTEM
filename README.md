Processing Codes for 4D-BioSTEM Project in LBEM
======

This repository presents the codes used in the 4D-BioSTEM project. Details of the individual projects and publications are found in their corresponding notebooks.

## Low-dose cryo-electron ptychography of proteins at sub-nanometer resolution

This repository contains the `Phi92_Notebook.ipynb`, which is designed to perform the data analysis as described in our recent publication "Low-Dose Cryo-Electron Ptychography of Proteins at Sub-Nanometer Resolution." The notebook includes detailed steps for the ptychographic reconstruction and analysis of the 4D-STEM data of the Phi92 bacteriophage.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `py4DSTEM`

py4DSTEM is an open-source software, and installation details can be found on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM).

### Data Access
The example 4D-STEM dataset for this notebook can be accessed at [Dataset link](<DatasetLink>). Additional datasets of Apoferritin, Phi92 bacteriophage, and Tobacco Mosaic Virus are available in the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR) with the accession code EMPIAR-XXX.
